1. RequestDispatcher
======================

The RequestDispatcher interface is used to dispatch a request from one servlet to another resource (which could be another servlet, JSP, or HTML file) within the same web application. It helps in forwarding requests or including responses from another resource.

 Methods:
---------

        forward(request, response):

 Forwards the request from one servlet to another resource without returning to the calling servlet. The response is generated by the second resource.


        include(request, response): 

Includes content from another resource in the response. The control returns to the original servlet after including the content.

----------------------------------
What is a Filter?

A filter is used to perform filtering tasks such as logging, authentication, or modifying request and response data before the request reaches the servlet.

Example Scenario:

We will create a filter that logs details like the request URL and the client's IP address before it forwards the request to the servlet.
Steps:

    Create a Filter: The filter will log request information.
    Create a Servlet: The servlet will handle the request after it passes through the filter.
    Configure the Filter in web.xml or use annotations.
